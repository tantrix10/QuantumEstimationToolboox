This work is an extension of the [original work](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevA.95.052132) from Jukka Kiukas, Kazuya Yuasa, and Daniel Burgarth. 

Here we extend the scenario to estimating a magnetic field across the entire spin chain, instead of the final site.

The code presented here is an extension to that which Jukka Kiukas originally wrote for the above linked paper.

Reminder: This branch is being left as is, to be an accurate reflection of the code as presented in my thesis. 
I will tidy up  and improve the general use of this code on the main branch.
