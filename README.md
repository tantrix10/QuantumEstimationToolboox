# Thesis


This repo contains all the code used to generate numerical results within my thesis.

Reproducibility in science is fundamentally important.
Therefore, the code will remain functionally in tact so that the results can be immediately reproduced.

Changes will be made to the general structure, to reduce code re-use and ensure the required environment can be reliably be built.
